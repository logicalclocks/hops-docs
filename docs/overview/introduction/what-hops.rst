What is Hops?
===========================


Hops is a next-generation distribution of Apache Hadoop, with a heavily adapted impelementation of HDFS, called HopsFS.
HopsFS is a new implementation of the Hadoop Filesystem (HDFS) based on `Apache Hadoop`_ 2.8, that supports multiple stateless NameNodes, where the metadata is stored in an in-memory distributed database (NDB). HopsFS enables NameNode metadata to be both customized and analyzed, because it can be easily accessed via SQL or the native API (NDB API).

   HopsFS Architeture.

HopsFS replaces HDFS's Active-Standby Replication architecture with a set of stateless (redundant) NameNodes backed by an in-memory, shared nothing NewSQL database. HopsFS provides the DAL-API as an abstraction layer over the database, and implements a leader election protocol using the database. This means HopsFS no longer needs the following services required by Apache HDFS: quorum journal nodes, Zookeeper, and the Snapshot server.
