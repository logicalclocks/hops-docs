===========================
Data Set Browser
===========================

The Data Set tab enables you to browse Data Sets, files and directories in this project.
It is mostly used as a file browser for the project's HDFS subtree. You cannot navigate to
directories outside of this project's subtree. For a quick preview of
a file, go to the ``Datasets`` menu, navigate to a file, right click
on that file and choose the ``Preview`` option. A pop-up window will
appear with a small preview of the file. The picture below illustrates the Dataset Browser
with a new sample dataset. You can add new datasets pressing the
``Create New Dataset`` button. You can edit the datasets by right
clicking on them. A README file is auto-generated for every dataset.
